Here are your task:

- use the current folder to develop the project. It is using `sveltekit`, `tailwind` and `npm`. Check the file @/package.json to make sure you are aware of all technologies of this project
- search on internet to make sure you are using the most updated version of all libs
- generate all copywriting content. The proposal is a service to everyone that needs a website or landing page quick, personalized, exclusive.
- The database of the project is postgres.

Divide the development in several steps, and after each step:

- start with the backend using the `backend.INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.
- after finishing all the backend, start the frontend using the `frontend.INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.
- after read each file, break it into several steps to facilitate the creation and mitigate the rist
- run the command `npm run check` to make sure there's no errors in the project.
- if you find any error with the command `npm run check`, fix it
- run the command `npm run lint` to make sure the agent is following all the best practices of the project.
- if you find any error with the command `npm run lint`, fix it
- **never use the npm command**
- **always use the `npm` command** to add or remove libs, or execute any command of package.json file
- **never start the project**, I will do that when you finish
- The database is Postgres. To run the migrations, use the `npm run db:push --force` command
- when you identify duplicated code, refactor the code and create reusable components. Follow the DRY (don't repeat yourself)


## Frontend Instructions
